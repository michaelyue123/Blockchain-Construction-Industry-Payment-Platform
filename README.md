# Blockchain-Construction-Industry-Payment-Platform

Blockchain-Construction-Industry-Payment-Platform is a mobile-friendly web application focusing on resolving issues related to payment practices in construction industry. 

Specifically, this application allows users (project owner) to create and manage projects via their own dashboards. After creating a project, project owner can invite another user (project lead) to join and co-manage the project together. Later, project lead can negotiate with other subcontractors to complete the whole project. Here, our app introduces another important feature to make sure the project running smoothly, which is creating contract. Upon forming different contracts among project owner, project lead and subcontractors, they are all chained and bound together legally. 

Importantly, our core function provides both project lead and subcontractors a platform to claim their work and get their money on time. Essentially, money flow will be controlled by smart contract which is a computer program executing according to the written contracts signed earlier. By leveraging blockchain technology, our app is able to make fast, accurate and secure payment to every user down the chain.
