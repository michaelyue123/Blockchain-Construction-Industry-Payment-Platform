                <h3>Cascade Chain</h3>
                 <p>At Cascade Chain, we understand that building and construction companies, of all sizes, rely on their trusted networks and relationships to deliver projects, satisfy customers, and put food on the table of all those involved. The trust is earned, valued, and can span many years, until something goes wrong. The “something” always involves money and disputes over the payment amount, payment timing, or lack of payment. It often ends in someone going bust and losing their business because of the financial management and decisions made by those further up the payment chain. This problem costs the Australian building and construction industry billions of dollars each year and results in over 25% of all insolvencies coming from the building and construction industry. At this point, we want to acknowledge the stress and loss that these experiences create and the need to offer a solution that benefits all involved.  This is where Cascade Chain come in.</p>

                <h3>Why do we care?</h3>
                <p>With over 25 year in the building and construction industry, we have been affected by all forms of issues related to poor payment practices, including delayed payment, non-payment, and illegal phoenixing activities. In 2008, I worked for a new company that went into liquidation. I was forced to shut projects down, was not able to pay contractors and creditors and was left wondering how could this happen? The reality struck when a small business that I subcontracted to do the cleaning work, a hard-working single parent who I had known for years, lost her business, her income, and her future. It was devastating for all involved, accept the boss who walked away with a pocket full of cash. This should not happen.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Cash flow is the lifeblood of our industry and for this to flow we need to honour our agreements and professional relationships. Cascade Chain builds trust into payment practices by allowing the cash to flow, securing the link in the chain, and removing the risk, so everyone can prosper.</p>
